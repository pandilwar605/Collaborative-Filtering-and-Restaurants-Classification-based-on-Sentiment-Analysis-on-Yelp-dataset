# Collaborative-Filtering-and-Restaurants-Classification-based-on-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Yelp-dataset
Z534 Search Project on Yelp Dataset
- **Project member**: Sanket, Akshay, Camilla
- **Description**: This is a Yelp dataset research project on collaborative filtering and classification with Sentiment Analysis

Follwing are the python notebook files we used for the project.

### **1. Data Visualization and EDA on Yelp Dataset**

This file has data preprocessing of yelp dataset files. It also contains EDA and Data Visualization for the project.

### **2. Extracting Restaurants Data for Algorithms**

This is a necessary data preparation needed for user and item based collaborative filtering algorithms and prediction model.

### **3. Collaborative Filtering using different approach**

This file has implementation and evaluation of User and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering algorithms using ratings. It also contains the code for Item-Based CF using reviews with TF-IDF Score.

### **4. Sentiment Analysis and Classification of Restaurant**

This file contains Sentiment Analysis of reviews and tips text. We have implemented classification of restaurants using different algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, Ada Boost, and Multi-layer Perceptron. It also has classifiers vs accuracy graph and evaluation metrics such as Recall, Precision, Accuracy and F1 Score for each classifier.
